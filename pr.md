1. What did you like about this website?
    - I think your website is really clean, I really liked the background photos. I thought thay they since they were
        darker they gave a nice contrast to the actual information on the page. The spinning poker chip was also pretty cool.
2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    2a. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        - I think yours had a better user expereince, there was a lot more to interact with on your site.
    2b. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        - I think they are both maintainable. You did separated your files well.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    if not, suggest some specific improvements
        - Yes your code is well-structured. There also isn't much repetition of css which is good. 
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    4a. were semantically appropriate elements selected
        - Yes.
    4b. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
        - Yes CSS was set up to limit duplication.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    - Only resizing issue I found was when you made the browser as narrow as possible on the learn how to play page it got a bit weird with the image, the image would be longer than the nav bar, but it didn't do it on the mobile displays so you were good there.
    - I thought it was interesting that you decided to use divs to seperate your navigation instead of putting them in a nav tag, but if it works it works I don't think it makes a difference.
    - You also used a lot of breaks to add spacing at the top of your divs, for example on your home page you did a lot of breaks to move the text down instead of using CSS to position it, but again if it works it works I don't think it makes a difference.
    - I also think its better to make the textbox on the form not resizeable, I think it makes it look better and there isn't much of a point for a user to need to resize the box. //     resize: none;    //
    - Overall really nice website, nice color selections, background images, nice file structuring, and I think you displayed the information really well.
